# Kingsley Charm Finder

## Description

The **Kingsley Charm Finder** is a Python application with a GUI that allows users to search for specific charms listed on the Steam Market. It allows users to search by charm name, specify a range of template numbers, and scrape data from multiple pages of the Steam Market. The results are then sent via a Discord webhook with a link to the listing and the template number, making it easy to track and monitor specific charms.

The application is built using `tkinter` for the GUI, `requests` for HTTP requests, and `BeautifulSoup` for scraping the Steam Market pages.
